# README: Image_Captioning_ConvNet_LSTM.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook, renamed as "Image_Captioning_ConvNet_LSTM.ipynb", provides a comprehensive guide to the construction and implementation of an image captioning model using a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with the help of PyTorch. The notebook also includes detailed sections on implementing and understanding the workings of a Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is organized into several key sections:

### 1. Vanilla RNN

This section is dedicated to the implementation of a Vanilla RNN. The forward and backward passes for a single timestep of a Vanilla RNN are developed here. The section includes:

- `rnn_step_forward`: This function computes the forward pass for a single timestep of a vanilla RNN.
- `rnn_step_backward`: This function computes the backward pass for a single timestep of a vanilla RNN.

These functions are tested against expected results to validate their accuracy.

### 2. RNN for an Entire Sequence of Data

The notebook progresses to extend the Vanilla RNN implementation for an entire sequence of data. The developed functions in this section are:

- `rnn_forward`: This function is responsible for running a Vanilla RNN forward on an entire sequence of data.
- `rnn_backward`: This function computes the backward pass for a Vanilla RNN over an entire sequence of data.

Each function is validated using testing cells that compare the function's results to expected results and gradients.

### 3. Image Captioning with ConvNet and LSTM

This section introduces the task of image captioning. It involves the construction of an image captioning model comprising two main components: a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) for extracting features from images, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for generating captions based on these features.

### 4. Loading a Pre-trained Model and Generating Captions

The notebook demonstrates how to load a pre-trained image captioning model and use it to generate captions for a given image. A function, `load_image`, is provided to prepare an image for input to the model. Subsequently, it showcases how the pre-trained model can generate a caption for an image.

## Dependencies

The notebook leverages several Python libraries:

- `PyTorch`: Used for building and training neural networks.
- `torchvision`: Employed for loading and transforming datasets.
- `numpy`: Used for numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: Used for generating plots and visualizations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository containing the notebook.
2. Ensure all the required dependencies are installed.
3. Open the "Image_Captioning_ConvNet_LSTM.ipynb" notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Execute the cells in the notebook to observe the creation and functioning of the Vanilla RNN, the sequence processing of the RNN, and the construction and use of the image captioning model.

## Results

The notebook contains cells that test the functions and methods implemented throughout the notebook. These cells print relative errors compared to expected results, which should be close to zero if the implementations are correct. In the final part of the notebook, an image is processed through a pre-trained image captioning model, which generates a caption for the image.
